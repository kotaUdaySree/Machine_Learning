 Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

## Introduction

Hello! Welcome to the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) assignment. In this assignment, you will learn how to implement two different support vector machine models to predict whether customers are more likely to purchase new vehicles after receiving ad emails. We'll be using two features: age and salary from the provided dataset.

The dataset (`SVMs_dataset`) contains customer information for an auto company. It consists of five columns, including four features (Customer ID, Gender, Age, Salary) and one result (Purchased). This is a binary classification problem, where '1' indicates a purchase and '0' indicates no purchase.

## Task Description

Your objective is to implement two different SVM models to accomplish the same task. You'll find two Python implementations (`SVMs-01.py` and `SVMs-02.py`) with 100% of the working source codes to help you understand the flow of the implementations. However, feel free to use your own programming flow or strategies if you prefer. You are not obligated to use the provided templates fully or partially.

## Dataset Details

- Total Samples: 400
- Features (Inputs): Customer ID (x1), Gender (x2), Age (x3), Salary (x4)
- Output: Purchased (y)

## Repository Contents

- `SVMs-01.py`: Implementation using Technique 1.
- `SVMs-02.py`: Implementation using Technique 2.
