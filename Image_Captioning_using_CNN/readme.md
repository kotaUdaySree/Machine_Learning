### Image Captioning using Encoder CNN and Decoder RNN

#### Introduction

This code implements an image captioning system using a combination of an Encoder Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Decoder Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This system takes an image as input and generates a descriptive caption.

#### Setup

Before running the code, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

```
pip install -qU openimages torch_snippets urllib3
pip install torch_snippets
pip install lovely-tensors
pip install torchtext
pip install matplotlib-venn
pip install pydot
pip install cartopy
pip install torchtext==0.6.0
pip install pycocotools
```

#### Usage

1. **Downloading Data**
   
   - The code downloads caption data from a specified URL and saves it as `open_images_train_captions.jsonl`.
   
   ```python
   url = 'https://storage.googleapis.com/localized-narratives/annotations/open_images_train_v6_captions.jsonl'
   response = requests.get(url)
   
   with open('open_images_train_captions.jsonl', 'wb') as f:
       f.write(response.content)
   ```

2. **Training the Models**

   - The code trains the models for image captioning using a combination of an Encoder CNN and a Decoder RNN. This involves several steps:
   
     - Data preprocessing, including building a vocabulary and setting up data loaders.
     - Defining and training the Encoder CNN and Decoder RNN models.
     - Saving checkpoints for the trained models.
     - Evaluating the models on validation data.

   - To run the training, execute the code in sections labeled "Define encoder, decoder, loss function, and optimizer" and "Train the model over increasing epochs".

3. **Generating Captions for Images**

   - Once the models are trained, you can generate captions for specific images. To do this, execute the code in the section labeled "Generating Captions for a Specific Image".

   - Make sure you have the pre-trained encoder and decoder model checkpoints (`encoder_checkpoint.pt` and `decoder_checkpoint.pt`) in the same directory.

4. **Results**

   - The code provides a way to generate captions for images. Sample outputs will be displayed, demonstrating the model's performance.

#### Requirements

Make sure to have the following libraries installed:
- `openimages`
- `torch_snippets`
- `lovely-tensors`
- `torchtext`
- `matplotlib-venn`
- `pydot`
- `cartopy`
- `torchtext==0.6.0`
- `pycocotools`

You can install them using the provided commands.

#### Acknowledgments

- This code is based on the concept of image captioning using Encoder CNN and Decoder RNN, and it makes use of pre-trained models and datasets. 

#### Additional Notes

Include any additional information or specific instructions for running the code, if necessary.
