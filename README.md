# Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Repository! This repository documents my journey through the exciting world of machine learning. Here, you'll find implementations of various Machine Learning Algorithms and Techniques.

## Contents

### Regression Techniques

Regression analysis is fundamental in predictive modeling. In this section, I've tackled regression problems using various techniques, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.

### Neural Networks

This section is dedicated to the study and implementation of various Neural Network architectures. I've worked on feedforward neural networks, deep learning models, and more. Explore this section to delve into the world of neural networks.


### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Recurrent Neural Networks are a powerful class of models for sequential data. In this section, I've developed RNN-based solutions for tasks like text generation, time series prediction, and more.


### Image Captioning using CNN

In this section, I explore the fascinating domain of computer vision and natural language processing. The project focuses on generating textual descriptions for images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). You can find detailed code, data, and results in this directory.


### Support Vector Machine (SVM) Models

SVMs are widely used for classification and regression tasks. This section contains implementations of SVM-based models for solving classification problems. You can also find the updated README file here.


## Environment

I've used Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab to develop and run the files in my local machine.
